Vignette abstract: a brief description in a few sentences of your vignette topic, example data, and outcomes. Our vignette topic is on random forests, specifically, building a predictive classification and regression model using random forest ensemble. We want to use these examples of random forest in the classification and regression setting to guide someone new to random forests through its applications. We used the titanic dataset for our classification example and the auto dataset for our regression model example.

The auto dataset consists of 392 observations on the following nine features:

- Miles per gallon

- Number of cylinders

- Engine displacement

- Horsepower

- Vehicle weight

- Acceleration

- Year

- Origin

- Name

The titanic dataset consists of the following features for 891 passengers aboard the Titanic:

- Passenger id

- Survived (yes/no)

- Passenger class

- Name

- Sex

- Age

- Sib_sp (number of siblings and spouses aboard)

- Parch (number of parents and children aboard)

- Ticket number

- Ticket fare

- Cabin number
